# **Cluster Ninja Academy: Mastering the Way of the Windows Command Line**

Welcome, young ninjas, to the hallowed halls of **Cluster Ninja Academy**. Here, you will learn to wield the power of the Windows command line with the precision and skill of a true ninja. Each command is like a throwing star—sharp, swift, and deadly in the right hands. Prepare yourselves for the ultimate training session where you’ll become a master of the command line arts.

### **1. `cd`: The Ninja's Silent Step**
Every ninja needs to move swiftly and silently between locations. The `cd` (Change Directory) command is your teleportation jutsu, allowing you to jump from one directory to another without a trace.

To silently step into your Documents:

```bash
cd Documents
```

Need to retreat to your previous hideout (directory)? Execute a backflip:

```bash
cd ..
```

For a precise strike to a specific location:

cd C:\Windows\System32
```

**Explanation:**  
- **`cd`** allows you to change the current directory you're working in.
- **`..`** represents moving up one level in the directory tree.
- **`cd` followed by a path** moves you directly to that specific directory.

### **2. `dir`: The Ninja's All-Seeing Eye**
With the `dir` (Directory) command, you can scout the area, revealing all the files and folders in your current location. It’s your ninja way of gathering intel before making your next move.

dir
```

For a more detailed reconnaissance, including hidden files:

```

To create a series of hidden rooms:
